# circle-pleating
It bridges the gap between circle packing and box pleating; thus, circle pleating. 

Instructions to use:
1. Use Robert Lang's Treemaker (v5) to input your tree, and scale everything. You can download treemaker here: https://langorigami.com/article/treemaker/ You can use treemaker to build a crease pattern, but it's not necessary. Make sure to save your .tmd5 file.
2. Run the circle-pleating program. There will be a button to "Open Treemaker file." Click that, and select your .tmd5 file. 
  If you generated a cp with treemaker, it will show up in the square on the left. You can use this program to export the cp as .cp, so you can further edit the cp in orihime or oripa.
3. Regardless of whether treemaker generated a cp, you can click "approximate to bp," as long as treemaker found a valid packing. You may see that there are overlapping flaps, so increase the grid size until they go away or you have a "comfortable" grid size. If you need to lower the grid size, you can click on "approximate to bp" again.
4. There will be some flaps that need pythagorean stretches--after all, that's the whole concept of this conversion from circle packing to boxpleating. You can calculate the pythas one at a time using this calculator: https://github.com/theplantpsychologist/Pytha-calculator
5. That's it for now. I will be adding more features later.
